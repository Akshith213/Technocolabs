Technocolabs internship
## Mini Project:
* I have created 2 notebooks, all the EDA and a BiLstm was implemented in 'Toxic_Comment_Challenge' notebook and the Roberta model was implemented and deployed in 'Toxic_Comment_Challenge_Roberta' notebook. 
## Steps to follow to deploy the model:
* Open 'Toxic_Comment_Challenge_Roberta' file and click on 'open in Colab'.
* Next create a folder called 'templates' and upload the 'index.html' file which is in the Repository. (To create 'templates' folder go to files section in colab, right click and select 'New Folder' and give the name as 'templates'.
* Go to runtime and click on 'Run all', after running the first cell, authorize your google drive and wait for a few minutes.
* Finally, you will get a ngrok link which will direct you to the website.
