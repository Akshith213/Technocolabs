Technocolabs internship
* I have created 2 notebooks, all the EDA and a BiLstm was implemented in 'Toxic_Comment_Challenge' notebook and the Roberta model was implemented and deployed in 'Toxic_Comment_Challenge_Roberta' notebook. 
## Steps to follow to deploy the model:
* Open 'Toxic_Comment_Challenge_Roberta' file and click on 'open in Colab'.
* Next create a folder called 'templates' and upload the 'index.html' file which is in the Repository.
* Go to runtime and click on 'Run all' and wait for 5 minutes.
* Finally, you will get a ngrok link which will direct you to the website
